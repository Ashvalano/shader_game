# Utilization of Shaders Algorithm to Simulate a 3D Isometric Game

This thesis package is a 3D isometric game developed in Unity by BSCS Students of West Visayas State University - College of Information and Communications Technology.

## Synopsis

The isometric game employs the use of shaders algorithm to enhance the value of the game. The algorithm applies pixel shaders and uses Cinemachine from Unity to pan and turn the game camera, revealing the 3D aspects of the environment which would have been otherwise unseen.

## Motivation

The researchers’ motivations stem from being game enthusiast themselves, and a fascination towards pixel graphics and retro isometric games (Diablo, Baldur’s Gate). 

## Installation

Download the game files as ZIP in this repository. To install, use file archiver tools such as winrar, and unzip the file. To run the game, locate ThesisProject.exe.
